Expression Injector ReadMe

This is a script lets you select preset layer properties, and apply a custom expression to all the selected layers. It is relatively basic, as it doesn't check if it is a valid expression, and does not have many options for properties to select. But the latter can be changed relatively easily by changing the dropDown and adjusting the getPropertyName function.
